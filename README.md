# Cross Stitch Pattern Drawing Tool 
A tiny web app for drawing cross stitch patterns. 
Less than 100 lines of code with a little html, css, jquery, and an erb compiler.
Play with it [here](https://alyssahursh.github.io/cross-stitch/).

## Sample pattern and completed project

## Technologies
* jQuery
* HTML5/CSS3
* Ruby 2.3.1
* Deployed with Github pages

## How to use
[Click on over to the app](https://alyssahursh.github.io/cross-stitch/), then just start clicking around. Change your drawing color by clicking on the palette to the right. Made a mistake? That's okay, it happens. Clicking on an already-colored square will either update the square's color to your current drawing color, or — if the square's color and the drawing color are the same — turn the square white.

## Using this tool seems really tedious
Yeah, well so is cross stitch

## Why did you build this?
1. I had a cross stitch project in mind and needed a tool to plan the layout.
1. When I was 10, I tried to make my own cross stitch patterns in Excel, but Excel didn't have conditional formatting yet, so changing the color of every cell took 3+ clicks. I just wanted to build the thing that 10-year-old-me had wanted, and to make that kid proud.
1. I wanted to see what I could build in <100 lines (without writing totally obtuse code)

## If I had more time
* I'd build out an option to bulk-clear either by color or by selecting an area.
* I'd fix the cell resizing that happens on narrow screens.
* I'd add darker gridlines to demarcate rows and columns of 10 squares to facilitate with stitch counting. 
* I'd develop an alphabet tool to allow a user to place letters rather than having to draw them by hand.
