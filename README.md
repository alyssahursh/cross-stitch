# Cross Stitch Pattern Drawing Tool
A tiny app for drawing cross stitch patterns. 
Less than 100 lines of code with a little html, css, jquery, and an erb compiler.

# How to use
[Click on over to the app](https://alyssahursh.github.io/cross-stitch/), then just start clicking around. Change your drawing color by clicking on the palette to the right. Made a mistake? That's okay, it happens. Clicking on an already-colored square will either update the square's color to your current drawing color, or — if the square's color and the drawing color are the same — turn the square white.

# Why did you build this?
1. I wanted to see what I could build in <100 lines (without writing totally obtuse code)
1. I had a cross stitch project in mind and needed a tool to plan the layout.
1. When I was 10, I tried to make my own cross stitch patterns in Excel, but Excel didn't have conditional formatting yet, so changing the color of every cell took 3+ clicks. I just wanted to build the thing that 10-year-old-me had wanted.

# Using this tool seems really tedious
Yeah, well so is cross stitch

# If I had more time
* I'd love
